<h2>Tracking User Behaviour </h2>

<h2>Automatically Collected Information </h2>
<p>Information about your computer hardware may be automatically collected by Community Care Hub. This information can include your IP address, browser type, domain names,

<h2>Use of Cookies </h2>
<p>The Community Care Hub website may use “cookies” to help you personalise your online experience. A cookie is a text file placed on your hard disk by a web page server.
    Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver malware to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you and can only be read by
    a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. </p>
<p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page.
    For example, if you personalise CCH pages, or register with CCH sites and services, a cookie helps CCH to recall your specific information on subsequent visits.
    This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, including first and last names, and email addresses. When you return to the same CCH website,
    the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the CCH features you have customised. </p>
<p>You can accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer.
    If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the CCH services or websites you visit. </p>
<p>You can view our cookie policy <a asp-page="CookiePolicy">here.</a></p>
